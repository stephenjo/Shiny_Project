# Shiny_Project
R code for shiny application

Contained here are 3 files
1) ui.R (conatins code for the user interface aspect)
2) server.R (conatins code for the server side, this is where most of the processing is done)
3) global.R (conatins code for loading the dataset(s)) 

Note: the global file assumes the file loaded is specically formated for the application. This portion has been ommited for start up time efficiency. It will not work for an unaltered citibike dataset! If you would like the formating code or want more information just ask me.)
