# Shiny_Project
R code for shiny application

Contained here are 3 files
1) ui.R (conatins code for the user interface aspect)
2) server.R (conatins code for the server side, this is where most of the processing is done)
3) global.R (conatins code for loading the dataset(s)) 

Note: the global file assumes the file loaded is specically formated for the application. It will not work for an unaltered citibike dataset! If you would like to see the formating code or want more information just ask me for it. It has been ommited so the start up time for the app is much quicker)
